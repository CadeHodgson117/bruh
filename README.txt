This website serves as my portfolio for my early projects in my games production and design experiences. This portfolio goes over my contact information, my projects done with specific programs such as Unity and Game Maker as well as my limited experience with C++ which is almost entirely done within my first few weeks in uni, and a few mentions of my skills and other minor experiences within other aspects of game productions. The template used I feel was appropriate and feels professional.
