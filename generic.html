							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Pacman.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This project initially began as a rendition of the classic game "Pacman" with all the standard features and gameplay mechanics albeit somewhat simpler and lacking similar presentation. Soon after completing this, I made some changes to the sprites of the game itself so that it could remain visually distinct and unique.</p>
							<p>This project was also my first experience with using the S2D framework within C++ which is a very basic framework that lay the groundwork for what the rest of the game would end up being, as well as serving as a stepping stone for my learning journey with C++ as a whole.</p>

					<h1 class="major">C++ Project "Mario"</h1>
					<span class="image"><img src="images/Mario.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>This was a project done as part of my University course where I was tasked with recreating Mario using the SDL framework. It was a huge step for me as a programmer as it introduced a number of programming techniques that are really helpful.</p>
